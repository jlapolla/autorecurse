### Remaking Makefiles

`autorecurse` reads makefiles in their current state to generate nested
targets. If a makefile needs to be remade, the nested targets may be
incorrect.

When `autorecurse` cannot find a makefile to read, it passes the command
line arguments to `make` without generating nested targets. This
prevents a time-consuming recursive makefile search if the user
accidentally calls `autorecurse` in the wrong directory (e.g. the root
directory). When `autorecurse` invokes `make`, `make` will attempt to
remake a makefile using its implicit rules. In most cases `make` will
fail. However, in some cases `make` will succeed in remaking a makefile
and it will run without the help of nested targets generated by
`autorecurse`.
