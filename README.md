### User File Locations

`autorecurse` stores configuration and other data specific to each user
on a machine. This section describes where that data resides.

#### Symbolic Locations

`autorecurse` stores its data in different locations based on the
machine's operating system and the specific variant of `autorecurse`.
For portability, `autorecurse` internally uses symbolic locations.
Symbolic locations are mapped to real locations based on the current
operating system.

This section describes the symbolic locations. The following sections
map each symbolic location to a real location for a particular operating
system. The real location is often a file or folder in the file system,
but this is not always the case. For instance, some data may be stored
in the Windows registry or GConf.

The symbolic locations are:

- `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCAL`: User and machine configuration values. These
  values are customized by the user. These values should be backed up on
  operating systems with built-in backup support. Note that these values
  are not **roaming** (i.e. they are not synced across user devices
  running the same operating system).
- `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCALCACHE`: Cached values created by `autorecurse` on
  the user's behalf. `autorecurse` can automatically generate these
  values again when it needs them. The values in
  `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCALCACHE` help `autorecurse` execute faster on
  subsequent invocations. These values may be deleted, and need not be
  backed up on operating systems with built-in backup support.
- `AUTORECURSE_USRTMP`: Folder for temporary files used by
  `autorecurse`. Files in this folder are deleted before `autorecurse`
  finishes executing. `AUTORECURSE_USRTMP` is typically mapped to a
  system-wide temporary file system so files here will eventually be
  deleted by the operating system if `autorecurse` fails to delete them.
  This is considered a user folder because files here are generated by a
  particular user running `autorecurse`.

#### Linux

- `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCAL` = `~/.autorecurse/local`
- `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCALCACHE` = `~/.cache/autorecurse` [\[1]\][1]
- `AUTORECURSE_USRTMP` = `~/.autorecurse/tmp`

#### Windows

**TO BE DECIDED**

#### OS X

**TO BE DECIDED**

### System File Locations

`autorecurse` does not store any configuration or other data meant for
use by all users on a machine.
