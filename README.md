### User File Locations

Aside from installation and code files, `autorecurse` reads and writes
configuration and other files specific to each user on a machine.

#### Symbolic Folders

`autorecurse` puts configuration and other files in different folders
based on the machine's operating system.

For compatibility, `autorecurse` internally uses symbolic folders,
mapping them to real folders as needed. The documentation for
`autorecurse` only refers to symbolic folders.

This section describes the symbolic folders. The following sections map
each symbolic folder to a real folder for a particular operating system.

The symbolic folders are:

- `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCAL`: Folder for user configuration files. These
  files are customized by the user, and `autorecurse` cannot generate
  them automatically. These files should be backed up on operating
  systems with built-in backup support. Note that these files are not
  **roaming** (i.e. they are not synced across user devices running the
  same operating system).
- `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCALCACHE`: Folder for cached files created by
  `autorecurse` on the user's behalf. `autorecurse` can automatically
  generate these files again when it needs them. The files in
  `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCALCACHE` serve only to help `autorecurse` execute
  faster on subsequent invocations. The files in this folder may be
  safely deleted, and need not be backed up on operating systems with
  built-in backup support.
- `AUTORECURSE_USRTMP`: Folder for temporary files used by
  `autorecurse`. Files in this folder are deleted before `autorecurse`
  finishes executing. `AUTORECURSE_USRTMP` is typically mapped to a
  system-wide temporary file system so files here will eventually be
  deleted by the operating system if `autorecurse` fails to delete them.
  This is considered a user folder because files here are generated by a
  particular user running `autorecurse`.

#### Linux

- `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCAL` = `~/.autorecurse/local`
- `AUTORECURSE_USRLOCALCACHE` = `~/.cache/autorecurse` [\[1]\][1]
- `AUTORECURSE_USRTMP` = `~/.autorecurse/tmp`

#### Windows

#### OS X

### System File Locations

`autorecurse` does not read or write any configuration or other files
meant for use by all users on a machine.
